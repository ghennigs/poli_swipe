# poli_swipe
art project
used other tinder clones
trying to setup a game style on a device without any of the backend usabilty. no actuall other real people interacting, just some pre-set 
cards "profiles' which the user swipes yes or no to.  

problem is that this clone is written for firbase, parse server etc.... and I do not know how to get errase the righ parts.
